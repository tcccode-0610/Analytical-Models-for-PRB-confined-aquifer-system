# Analytical-Models-for-PRB-confined-aquifer-system
The file contains two new analytical models describing 3D transport from a patch source in a PRB-confined aquifer system. The complete model applies governing equations to the up- and down-gradient formations and PRB in between. The Robin-MC model considers the PRB as a new Robin matching condition reflecting the effects of adsorption and reaction in the PRB.Â
